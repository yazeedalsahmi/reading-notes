# Growth Mindset
My name ***yazeed alshami*** I will talking about Growth Mindset.
**The growth mindset** believes that the individual is able to develop the basic for himself through *effort and perseverance*, which brings him greater productivity and opens up paths for creativity and potentials, as intelligence and talent are not everything and in the growth mindset a good start and the most important principles that the growth mindset seeks to establish in the soul is ***(love of learning)***.

As for the other type of mindset, it is the **fixed mindset** that views intelligence and talent as fixed traits, indicating that success comes from these qualities alone without the need for further development or effort.
## Benefits of a growth mindset :
* pathways to more creativity and possibility.
* enable the setting of higher goals.
* more achievement.
* love to learn more and more.
* Eliminate despair and increase hope.
