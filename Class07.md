we read this in 201, but this article was interesting in the fact that there is no real catch-all best way to operate a team. It seems like the more people get along and that there is more of a personal connection between all the members of the team, the more productive that team functions. To the outsider, it may appear that they are quite the opposite, but the proof is in the result.

## Who is Roy Fielding?
He is a guy who helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.

## Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
Because the large majority of developers were busy writing layers of complex specifications for how to access data in a different way that isn't nearly as useful or eloquent, known as SOAP.

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
HTTP is a protocol it's capable of all sorts of neat stuff that people ignore for some reason. It is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web.

## What does a GET do? Retrieve information from other servers.
## What does a POST do?
If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.

## What does PUT do?
If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT.

## What does PATCH do?
If a system wants to to do a partial update in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PATCH.

## How the web work?
The first is the first part of website ,which is the protocol HTTP, tells the browser what protocol to use.

That first part is on of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing, Because it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called REST. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to, and a web page is a representation of a resource.

The URLs tell the browser that there's a concept, somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept.

Web Services or APIs is the way computers use those same protocols to send messages back and forth to each other.

redirect is the ability to talk to all machines about all the stuff that's on all the other machines.

There are multiple "verbs" the protocol uses to talk to other machines, for example each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET. If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST. If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT.

and Things I want to know more about I want to know about API's.
