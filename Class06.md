The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the <br>“mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course <br>writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to <br>the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be <br>converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.
