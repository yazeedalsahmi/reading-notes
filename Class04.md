# What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
 Controlled Component is one that takes its current value through props and notifies changes through callbacks like onChange

Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.<br>
however, when I go into the Google Form for the quiz assignment and click on the Responses, I don't see any recorded response 

How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?<br>
The event also applies to elements with contenteditable enabled, and to any element when designMode is turned on. In the case of contenteditable and designMode, the event target is the editing host. If these properties apply to multiple elements, the editing host is the nearest ancestor element whose parent isn't editable.



Why would we use a ternary operator?<br>
Use the ternary operator to simplify your if-else statements that are used to assign values to variables. The ternary operator is commonly used when assigning post data or validating forms.


Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement<br>
  if(x===y){
 System.out.print(true);
  } else {
 System.out.print(false);
  }
