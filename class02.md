## How CSS works ??
**CSS** allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents 
of that box) is presented 
Using CSS, you could add a border around any of the boxes, specify its width and height, or 
add a background color. You could also control text inside a box â€” for example, its color, 
size, and the typeface used.
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern 
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule 
contains two parts: 
1. *a selector*.
2. *a declaration*.

**Example :** 
h1 {
text-color = red;
}
* **This rule** indicates that all `<h1>` elements should be red.
* **Selectors** indicate which element the rule applies to. 
The same rule can apply to more than one element if you 
separate the element names with commas.
* **Declarations** indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. 
Declarations are split into two parts (a property and a value), 
and are separated by a colon.
* **Properties** indicate the aspects of the element you want to change. For example, color, font, 
width, height and border.
* **Values specify** the settings you want to use for the chosen properties. For example, if you 
want to specify a color property then the value is the color you want the text in these elements 
to be.
