# Text Editor 
**A text editor** is a *computer program* that lets a user enter, change, store, and usually print text (characters and numbers, each encoded by the computer and its input and output devices, arranged to have meaning to users or to other programs) especially the text that you write
to build a web site.

 Typically, a text editor provides an "empty" display screen (or "scrollable page") with a fixed-line length and visible line numbers. You can then fill the lines in with text, line by line. 
 
 **A special command line :**
 * lets you move to a new page.
 * scroll forward or backward.
 * make global changes in the document.
 * save the document.
 *  perform other actions.
 
  After saving a document, you can then print it or display it. Before printing or displaying it, you may be able to format it for some specific output device or class of output device. Text editors can be used to enter program language source statements or to create documents such as technical manuals.

A popular text editor in IBM's large or mainframe computers is called XEDIT. In UNIX systems, the two most commonly used text editors are Emacs and Vi . In personal computer systems, word processor s are more common than text editors. However, there are variations of mainframe and UNIX text editors that are provided for use on personal computers. An example is KEDIT, which is basically XEDIT for Windows.
## Some features  in a text editor : 
 1. code completion;
 2. syntax
highlighting; 
3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue). 
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them. 
5. nice feature is being able to write your HTML and CSS more
efficiently. 
## Text editor programs :
1. Notepad++.
2. TextWrangler/BB Edit.
3. Visual Studio Code.
4. Atom.
5. Brackets.
6. Sublime Text.

**A text editor** kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text.
It also manages text, and manages files. I love that name “text
wrangler” because in a way that’s what really a text editor does. It
wrangles your text together into something meaningful.
**An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) **is really a suite of
different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
You can think about an IDE very much like Microsoft Outlook. If
you’ve ever used Microsoft Outlook, you would have quickly noticed
that it was an email client, a calendar, a task manager, a to-do list all
in one software package. Similar to how an IDE is an all-in-one
software package.
While you might not be ready, or have the need to use a compiler, or
a debugger when you’re just starting out in web development, you’ll
get to see how an IDE operates in your text editing software. When
you’re ready to use an IDE, you’ll be more confident in how to use it
because you’ll already had some experience with it by using your text
editor.
